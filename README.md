# SOF-shape-constraints-with-P-splines
This repository includes the necessary codes to fit scalar on function models, where we impose shape restrictions such as non-negativity, monotonicity or convexity on the coefficient function. This is achieved through P-splines, which allow to impose necessary and sufficient conditions, instead of the sufficient ones of the state of the art.
