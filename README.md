# SOF-shape-constraints-with-P-splines
This repository includes the necessary codes to fit scalar on function models, where we impose shape restrictions such as non-negativity, monotonicity or convexity on the coefficient function. This is achieved through P-splines, which allow to impose necessary and sufficient conditions, instead of the sufficient ones of the state of the art.

_Note:_The data that generates each simulation can be found at this link (files too large to fit in Github): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FyTOp2nA6GeuzDxZ3lRP6um1nRE318fx/view?usp=sharing
